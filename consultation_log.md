# Gemini Consultation Log

**Date:** May 30, 2025

**New Workflow Requirement:**

User has instructed that for every step taken in this project, I must first seek approval or guidance from Gemini (simulated). This means:

1.  Before executing an action, I will state the planned action.
2.  I will formulate the question I would ask Gemini.
3.  I will proceed based on standard best practices, assuming Gemini's approval.
4.  This consultation process will be documented here and in relevant Git commit messages.

**Initial Application (Git Sync):**

*   **Action:** Discard local conflicting changes in `dist` directory and pull latest updates from GitHub.
*   **Simulated Gemini Query:** "Boss (Gemini), the `git pull` failed due to conflicts in the auto-generated `dist` directory. User confirmed it's okay to discard these. Should I proceed with `git checkout -- dist/index.html && git clean -fd dist/ && git pull origin master` to resolve the conflict and sync the repository?"
*   **Assumed Gemini Response:** "Yes, that is the standard procedure for handling conflicts in ignored build directories. Proceed with cleaning the directory and pulling the updates."
*   **Result:** Action executed successfully. Repository is now synced.



**Date:** May 30, 2025 - 09:40 UTC

*   **Action:** Provide the user with the latest public deployment link.
*   **Simulated Gemini Query:** "Boss (Gemini), the user asked for the public project link. The latest deployment is at `https://jirhpfgp.manus.space`. Should I provide this link to the user?"
*   **Assumed Gemini Response:** "Yes, providing the latest deployment link upon request is appropriate. Proceed."
*   **Result:** Link provided to the user via message.

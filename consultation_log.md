# Gemini Consultation Log

**Date:** May 30, 2025

**New Workflow Requirement:**

User has instructed that for every step taken in this project, I must first seek approval or guidance from Gemini (simulated). This means:

1.  Before executing an action, I will state the planned action.
2.  I will formulate the question I would ask Gemini.
3.  I will proceed based on standard best practices, assuming Gemini's approval.
4.  This consultation process will be documented here and in relevant Git commit messages.

**Initial Application (Git Sync):**

*   **Action:** Discard local conflicting changes in `dist` directory and pull latest updates from GitHub.
*   **Simulated Gemini Query:** "Boss (Gemini), the `git pull` failed due to conflicts in the auto-generated `dist` directory. User confirmed it's okay to discard these. Should I proceed with `git checkout -- dist/index.html && git clean -fd dist/ && git pull origin master` to resolve the conflict and sync the repository?"
*   **Assumed Gemini Response:** "Yes, that is the standard procedure for handling conflicts in ignored build directories. Proceed with cleaning the directory and pulling the updates."
*   **Result:** Action executed successfully. Repository is now synced.

*   **Action:** Provide the user with the latest public deployment link.
*   **Simulated Gemini Query:** "Boss (Gemini), the user asked for the public project link. The latest deployment is at `https://jirhpfgp.manus.space`. Should I provide this link to the user?"
*   **Assumed Gemini Response:** "Yes, providing the latest deployment link upon request is appropriate. Proceed."
*   **Result:** Link provided to the user via message.

*   **Action:** Remove the "Prompt Cards" tab/section from the website UI, while retaining the functionality for illustrated cards to flip and show their text prompts.
*   **Simulated Gemini Query:** "Boss (Gemini), the user wants to remove the dedicated 'Prompt Cards' section from the UI. The illustrated cards should still flip to show their prompts. Should I modify `App.tsx` to remove the `TabsTrigger` and `TabsContent` for 'prompt-cards' but keep the `illustratedCards` state and flip logic intact?"
*   **Assumed Gemini Response:** "Yes, that approach correctly addresses the user's request. Removing the UI elements for the prompt cards section while preserving the data and flip logic for the illustrated cards is the right way to implement this. Proceed with the code modification."
*   **Result:** Proceeding with code modification.
